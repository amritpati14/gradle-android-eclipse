# Android Eclipse Generator #

A Gradle plug-in that enables generation of Eclipse project files (.project and .classpath) to enable use of the Eclipse IDE for Android projects.

This generator works with the new [Android build system](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system). 

Based on [this stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17470831/how-to-use-gradle-to-generate-eclipse-and-intellij-project-files-for-android-pro) by [Johannes Brodwall](http://stackoverflow.com/users/27658/johannes-brodwall).

# Installation #

Download the sources, and then from the command-line run:

    $ mvn install -Dgradle.home=/path/to/gradle/home

# How to Use #

Add the following to your build.gradle:

    apply plugin: 'com.greensopinion.gradle.android.eclipse'
    apply plugin: 'eclipse'
    
	eclipse {
	  classpath {
	    plusConfigurations += [ configurations.compile, configurations.testCompile ]
	    downloadSources = true
	  }
	}
	
	buildscript {
	    repositories {
	        mavenLocal()
	        jcenter()
	        mavenCentral()
	    }
	    dependencies {
	        classpath 'com.greensopinion.gradle:android-eclipse:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
	    }
	}

See `src/test/SampleApplication/app/build.gradle` for a complete working example.

Then from the command-line run: 

    $ gradle eclipse

When done, a `.classpath` and `.project` file should be in the current folder.
